 <h1>A bit of a different start to design:</h1>
        <p>
          I started out my career as a front-end developer coming from an University with focus on development, mainly c++, c# and asp.NET.
          After a couple of years coding <span className='tag'>Web Designs</span> using <span className='tag'>HTML</span>,{' '}
          <span className='tag'>CSS</span> and
          <span className='tag'> jQuery</span> I realized I had troubles understanding the designers point of view, and decided to see what
          it was all about.
        </p>
        <p>
          Youtube was my best friend at that time, where I spent all of my free time learning what I needed to focus more on Design and
          leave coding behind. I started out with just <span className='tag'>Web Designs</span> and moved shortly to cross platform designs
          working at a fast pace for Agencies. I had not much formal experience with <span className='tag'>UX Design</span>, I just created
          <span className='tag'> UIs</span> based on my feel. I didn't know better at that point.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the years after I learned more and more about the psyhology behind the designs I had to create and got chances to work on
          in-house projects, completely from the begining, helping the stackeholders develop their ideas, find and realize their problems,
          and create solutions that would fit both their business plans and their users.
